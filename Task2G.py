###Areas to improve:

#Constants to adjust graphing results:
weightRelativeLevel = 10 #weight of the current water level
weightRisingWaterLevel = 1.5 #weight of rising water level
weightFallingWaterLevel = 0.9 #weight of lowering water level
stationWithinRadiusToCheck = [5,15,45,100] #distances from stations to check
stationWithinRadiusWeight = [0.05, 0.01, 0, 0] #weights of each distance above. Note that these are additive
stationOnRiverWeight = 0 #on the same river weight
cutoff = [150,100,60,30] #severe, high, moderate, low. Note these values are dependent on minimum level
orderOfInitialAssignment = 3 #the power that the current water level is taken to
orderofRisingLevel = 1.4 #the power that the rising water level is taken to
minimumLevel = 1.2 #minimum relative water level to consider rivers for further analysis
daysToConsider = 1 #how many days to consider for polynomial plot
